# PatchPeek

PatchPeek fetches the changelog of releases on GitHub, while checking for any potential breaking changes and displays it into a clean interface.

## PSA

This is very much a passion project from someone without a ton of knowledge on this subject that wanted to learn by doing, so mistakes will very likely have been made and will be made. Besides that, this is a small side hobby, so I don't have a ton of time to work on it and fix stuff. I hope you can understand!

## Features

- Minimalistic interface
- Minimal usage of GitHub API tokens
- Changelogs with breaking changes are highlighted
- Add repos by GitHub URL or only the author/repo slug
- Change the amount of days to look back for releases

## IMPORTANT INFO

- This app is intended to have a window of 31 days (My personal interval of updating containers) and while it does work if you enter 365 days for example, be aware of heavy GitHub API usage and longer load times. Just so you know, I am not condoning usage this far back, as I have not tested the rigidity of it.

- The app pulls releases from the GitHub API every 1 hour, which should provide enough requests for your needs without a GitHub token (but it is recommended to add one).

## Docker Compose

> [!NOTE]
> The container runs as root, but has the option to run rootless. Read the Important note carefully.

- Create a directory and add a `docker-compose.yaml` file with the following contents:

```
services:
  patchpeek:
    image: ghcr.io/ldannijs/patchpeek:latest
    container_name: patchpeek
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped
    # Uncomment the next line to run container as non-root user (node)
    # user: "1000:1000"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To run the container as rootless, uncomment the line as seen in the compose file, and then make sure you run:
>
> ```
> sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./data
> ```

- Then run:

```
docker compose up -d
```

Github token creation can be found here: https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens

## Locally running / Development

> [!NOTE]
> This project requires at least `Node 18`

- Clone the repo
- In the terminal, run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Motivation

This project came to fruition from me wanting to quickly know if any updates I were to do to my docker containers would break anything. I have used RSS feeds, discord notifications, etc. but they all felt too cumbersome to quickly give me the information i need at a glance.

Besides that I wanted to push myself to make a project like this and see how far i could get, alongside learn some stuff from it :)
