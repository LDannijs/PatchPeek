# PatchPeek

PatchPeek fetches the changelog of GitHub releases with the GitHub API, while checking for any potential breaking changes and puts it into a clean interface.

This project came to fruition for me wanting to quickly know if any updates i were to do to my docker containers would break anything. I have used RSS feeds and the likes but they all felt too cumbersome to quickly check.
