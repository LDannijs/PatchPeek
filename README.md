# ðŸ‘€ PatchPeek

PatchPeek fetches the changelog of GitHub releases with the GitHub API, while checking for any potential breaking changes and puts it into a clean interface.

This project came to fruition from me wanting to quickly know if any updates I were to do to my docker containers would break anything. I have used RSS feeds and the likes but they all felt too cumbersome to quickly check.

## IMPORTANT INFO

- This app is intended to be used/visited once every month, which is when I personally update all my containers. You can change the days to look back for, and while it does work if you enter 365 days for example, be aware of heavy GitHub API usage and longer load times. Just so you know, I am not condoning usage this far back, as i have not tested the rigidity of it.

- The app pulls releases from the GitHub API every 1 hour, and caches it based on the `If-None-Match` request header. This is to use less requests from the API then needed. Considering it only uses the API once every hour, running the app without a GitHub token should provide enough requests for your needs (but it is recommended to add one).

## Docker Compose

> [!NOTE]
> The container runs as root, but has the option to run rootless. Read the Important note carefully.

- Create a directory and add a `docker-compose.yaml` file with the following contents:

```
services:
  patchpeek:
    image: ghcr.io/ldannijs/patchpeek:latest
    container_name: patchpeek
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped
    # Uncomment the next line to run container as non-root user (node)
    # user: "1000:1000"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To run the container as rootless, uncomment the line as seen in the compose file, and then make sure you run:
>
> ```
> sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./data
> ```

- Then run:

```
docker compose up -d
```
